            <h1>Story of murugan: </h1>
            <p>Born from the divine sparks of Lord Shiva<em>'</em>s third eye, Lord Murugan emerged as six radiant infants, nurtured by the celestial Krittika stars and united by Goddess Parvati into one glorious form with six faces—symbolizing divine wisdom and perception. Destined to defeat the demon Tarakasura, Murugan was gifted the sacred Vel (spear) by Parvati and appointed commander of the celestial army. Riding his majestic peacock, he vanquished the mighty Surapadman, transforming him into a peacock and rooster to serve as his eternal symbols. Murugans life was not only marked by valor but also profound wisdom—he once questioned Brahma on the meaning of Om and, finding him ignorant, taught the truth himself. In a famous tale, when challenged to win a divine mango by circling the world, Murugan chose action over cleverness, flying around the earth on his peacock, only to lose to Ganesha, who simply circled his parents, declaring them his world. Feeling misunderstood, Murugan retreated to Palani Hill, where Shiva and Parvati consoled him with the words “Pazham Nee”—“You are the fruit.” Revered as Skanda, Kartikeya, and Subramanya, Murugan remains the embodiment of courage, humility, and spiritual insight, inspiring generations through sacred hymns, festivals, and the eternal light of his Vel.</p>
